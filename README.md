# Turtle_Racer


## Feb 21, 2022

A simple Python program that races turtles and allows people to place bets. 

This is my first real program outside of the terminal.

Goal was to practice using the graphics module Turtle, build and modify classes to generate turtles, and to practice using multiple functions.  

Inspiration came from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQP0geNsO4A though I only saw the final product at the end of the video.  I recreated the 'game' without seeing any of the Youtuber's code. 

**Things to fix : **
Winner's Circle type thing for the winning turtle.
Divide the file into multiple files.  Refactor code.
Create a lose / win condition for the gamblers.  Last man standing or something like that. 
Reduce Global variables. 

** Things to think about: **

I have questions about my variables.  I have global ones.   How do I avoid it?  

The function list at line 280 is ridiculous. 17 functions run in order to do this.  
That's silly.  But how do I avoid it?

Should cut some functions in half in order to return important information only. It would only extend the list at the end... but tighten up the code.
