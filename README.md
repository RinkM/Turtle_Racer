Feb 22,2022 Update V2
Made a number of small changes: an announcer who counts down and announces the winners. The losing gamblers go home. 

To do: 
A winner's circle would be fun. I think I can do it...

I have questions about my variables.  I have global ones.   How do I avoid it?  
The function list at line 280 is ridiculous. 17 functions run in order to do this.  
That's silly.  But how do I avoid it?
What does returning my functions do?  Should I cut some in half in order to return important information only.
If I return a variable, how do I access it later?   
For Gamblers function, can I cut it in half? return profile and call it good?  
And for function.variable things (racers?)

Also, deal with the k,v in dict.items.

I'm also making an update in order to see how GitHub works.

A simple Python program that races turtles and allows people to place bets. 

This is my first real program.  Goal was to practice using the Turtle module, Classes to generate turtles, and to practice using multiple functions.  Inspiration came from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQP0geNsO4A though ultimately, I only saw the final product and tried to reproduce it.  

Things to fix : 

When a gambler has 0 shells, the game won't advance. 

Countdown for the race. 

Winner's Circle type thing for the winning turtle.
