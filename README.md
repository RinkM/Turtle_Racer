# Turtle_Racer
Feb 21, 2022

A simple Python program that races turtles and allows people to place bets. 

This is my first real program.  Goal was to practice using the Turtle module, Classes to generate turtles, and to practice using multiple functions.  Inspiration came from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQP0geNsO4A though ultimately, I only saw the final product and tried to reproduce it.  

Things to fix : 

When a gambler has 0 shells, the game won't advance. 

Countdown for the race. 

Winner's Circle type thing for the winning turtle.
